# FinalProject-Mercamovel(In Development)
This is my final project for the programming course IÂ´ve completed.
This app concept is based on the buying experience of someone who attends fresh markets, where alot of people sell the same products with slightly different prices.
The idea is to help the users to find the best prices for each type of product and guide them to the right vendor.
The project is focused on being responsive to mobile devices like 360x800, 390x844, 414x896, 375x667, 412x732.
This project features:
    - Front-End in Javascript,HTML,CSS and Bootstrap
    - Back-End in PHP,SQL, MySQLWorkbench
    - AJAX Operations
    - UX UI design and Visual Identity skills aquired from my previous Multimedia course.
